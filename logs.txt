# entries decDist, centDist & milDist introduced to cover reduplication in distributive numbers
# (new sets of stems may be necessary?)
# ? unable to cover reduplication in other distributive numbers
16.12.20
# entries case & genitiveCase introduced to cover the case system
# genitives formed separately because of untersections with agreement markers
# classes OblSu, OblLi & OblPlLu introduced to distinguish between types of stems
# classes ErgD & ErgR introduced to distinguish the ergative markers
# class GenAgr introduced to distinguish between words that agree in the genitive and words that don't
# deleted Lexicon NumDative (no need for a special marker)
# added classes PlAbs & PlObl for noun plural marker
# RegDat class added to distinguish regular dative forms
# Lexicon DatExceptions added to cover irregular dative forms
#
# Oblique stems for nominalized numbers specified as 2 patterns
# One for those with agreement, see NomNumbersAgr
# One for items without agreement, see NomNumbersNonAgr
# Agreement & declension specified for all numbers with -da suffix
# ...
# Pattern DaSuffixedNums added not to repeat oneself
# replaced the older version in collective numbers
17.12.20
# Posited -i as a separate absolutive marker for plural noun forms (can be glossed as nominative)
# Exceptions in nominal morphology to memorize:
# Ras 'шкура' — GEN SG Rass-u-l— NOM PL Rass-abi. Исходная основа содержит геминированный согласный, теряющий геминацию в позиции передпаузой. Таких основ только три: Ras 'шкура', as 'кожаная привязь' и гаХ 'мерный кувшин объемом 5-6 литров'.
# j исходной основы перед суффиксом на согласный факультативно или обязательно — точная закономерность не установлена — выпадает; выпадение компенсируется удлинением предшествующего гласного, например: hjaj 'собака'— ERG SG hД-r, s'aj 'соль' — GEN SG s'a-l. To же может происходить, впрочем, и в абсолютном конце слова, ср. варианты Sij и ST 'молоко', GEN SG Si-i
# (twol rule may be required to handle the above regulation)
# ...
# added adjDouble & adjSingle for testing adjective agreement rules
# added agrInitial, agrMiddle & agrFinal to implement the agreement
# 2 twol rules for consonant conversion after nasalized vowels need to be implemented 
# ᵸ is to be used in the rules
# not sure, how to gloss initial agreement markers in verbs & adjectives, so that glosses don't come before the lemma
# left them without glosses for the time being
# ...
# implemented the 2 twol rules
# may need a rule for -a reduction at the end of the stem
# a common pattern in nominal declension
# ...
# ? question for the next time: which form should be used as the lemma for words with agreement markers
# ? -i at the end of the plural marker -abi can be either implemented as the absolutive case marker or via twol rule
# the latter approach makes it difficult to gloss it
# decided to implement it separately with a "nom" gloss
# temporarily changed PlAbi to PlBi.
# ? Need to decide, how to implement the vowel joints
# ...
# The absolutive stem might have a final -a that would be reduced in the oblique forms
# This makes the solution with a reduceable archphoneme -a at the end of the stem and a vowel at the start of the marker more convenient
# ...
# converbs & participles: may agree with 2 targets, so the scheme of "double adjectives" is reusable
# negative markers will be added to nominalized nouns as an optional suffix
# ...
# zero-marker nominative added to cases, classs nullNom to make an exception for nominalized numbers
# ...
# ? dative fusion is denied in the bagvalal vocabulary, it seems reasonable to cover both options
# Personal pronouns added in PerPronStems lexicon entry, exceptions listed in PerPronounExc
# added RegErg class to cases for correct personal pronoun coverage. PrExc added to pronouns for the same purpose
# ...
# optional negative suffixes added to personal pronouns, nominalized numbers - excluding genitive forms
# future goal: specify nominalized adjectives
# ...
# added ordinal lexicon entry to describe ordinal numbers
# ...
# distributive numbers need a separate lexicon entry for exceptions and one for reduced stems
# decided to add distributive one to rootOne as a separate class
# all the others merged in 2xrootinit & 2xrootdec
18.12.20
# added gloss <ten> to -аца, -ац modifiers to equal them with hundreds and thousands
# implemented all the distributive numbers
# ...
# ? need to add locative markers to nominalized numbers
# I suppose classes will be needed for the agreement markers to work properly
# the type of oblique stem in nominalized stem depends on the preceding agreement suffix
# need to specify a pattern for ser1 & ser2 ordinals not to repeat myself
# combinations of agreement markers with oblique stem markers might prove useful to be abstracted in the future
# after checking on the grammar decided to implement it as the OblAdj pattern
# need to add oblPlLi marker and fix the preceding
# OblAdjDative specified separately for mapping between agreement and reduced oblique stems
# ...
# OblAdj split between OblAdjAgr & OblAdjNonAgr to distinguish between terms that agree in the genitive and terms that do not
# ? might be necessary to consult the tutors on the removal of the negative marker for the time being
# it makes the forms too numerous and impossible to track down
# ...
# oblique stems and agreement markers may gloss the number differently, thus the analysis is not always consistent
# might need to remove the number glosses from the oblique stem markers
23.12.20
# added glosses to prefixal agreement markers
# added glosses <excl> & <incl> to personal pronouns
# Распределение показателей {1а} и {11а} локализаци и SUP , по-видимому,
# синхронно не мотивировано. Показатель {11а} отмечен в следующих случаях: 
# c'il-illa от с'ila 'щека', sim-i-lla от sim 'губа', mis'-i-lla от mis' 'язык', 
# hac'a-lla от hac'a 'глаз
...
# Since vowels always merge with preceding vowels when near each other, it may be helpful
# to describe the reduction of -i- before the directCase pattern with a twol rule.
...
# will try replacing some of the double strings with pipes
# added locative markers to all the present nominal forms
# created a twol rule for {i} deletion after any vowel
...
# twol converges as expected
# may be necesssary to specify the optional -ла- marker for ordinals
# replaced it with ordinalOpt marker
24.12.20
# I'm currently wondering, if there must be a gender gloss for oblique stem markers, 
since in the textbook it's they that get glossed as masculine or feminine
# number and gender in oblique stem markers are redundant in the case of nominalized order numerals
# and in nominalized adjectives as well, since the number there is given by the agreement marker
# still, it might be of use for all other parts of speech
# the textbook denotes the hpl demonstrative as "orur", while the dictionary as "obalur"
# orir and obalur for NPL in the respective order
...
# feels like the solution is to create two separate sets of oblique stem markers, one of which will
# have the relevant glosses (number & gender), while the other one wouldn't
# added -ха to DatExceptions for interrogatives (class Pron)
# added classes: interPronouns logPronouns demPronouns
# created oblAdjSingular & oblAdjPlural for cases in which gender & number glosses are required
# need to configure the relevant parts of speech
# adding -alu- to oblAdjPlural for the quantity pronoun
...
# RefSuffix for reflexives added
25.12.20
specified dative & superessive fusion for Li obliques in a separate pattern
Corrected the DatExceptions entry and all the related patterns.
Will need to make patterns for cases of super-essive fusion
...
Need to swap the obl gloss & gender + number glosses in relevant affixes
...
I probably should create an entry for dative exceptions with minimal glosses, name DatExcMin
OblPlAlu ought to be removed there
Now I should put DatExcMin & SupExcMin to forms, where additional glosses are not required
26.12.20
-ala - ending needed for dative & superessive cases of the quantity interrogative marker
...
-ala endings created in a separate voccabulary entry
...
i discovered that I haven't been supplying the superessive exclusions with directionality case markers
proceeding to correct
...
Added directCase to all the forms with the sup- marker
