# entries decDist, centDist & milDist introduced to cover reduplication in distributive numbers
# (new sets of stems may be necessary?)
# ? unable to cover reduplication in other distributive numbers
16.12.20
# entries case & genitiveCase introduced to cover the case system
# genitives formed separately because of untersections with agreement markers
# classes OblSu, OblLi & OblPlLu introduced to distinguish between types of stems
# classes ErgD & ErgR introduced to distinguish the ergative markers
# class GenAgr introduced to distinguish between words that agree in the genitive and words that don't
# deleted Lexicon NumDative (no need for a special marker)
# added classes PlAbs & PlObl for noun plural marker
# RegDat class added to distinguish regular dative forms
# Lexicon DatExceptions added to cover irregular dative forms
#
# Oblique stems for nominalized numbers specified as 2 patterns
# One for those with agreement, see NomNumbersAgr
# One for items without agreement, see NomNumbersNonAgr
# Agreement & declension specified for all numbers with -da suffix
# ...
# Pattern DaSuffixedNums added not to repeat oneself
# replaced the older version in collective numbers

# Posited -i as a separate absolutive marker for plural noun forms (can be glossed as nominative)
# Exceptions in nominal morphology to memorize:
# Ras 'шкура' — GEN SG Rass-u-l— NOM PL Rass-abi. Исходная основа содержит геминированный согласный, теряющий геминацию в позиции передпаузой. Таких основ только три: Ras 'шкура', as 'кожаная привязь' и гаХ 'мерный кувшин объемом 5-6 литров'.
# j исходной основы перед суффиксом на согласный факультативно или обязательно — точная закономерность не установлена — выпадает; выпадение компенсируется удлинением предшествующего гласного, например: hjaj 'собака'— ERG SG hД-r, s'aj 'соль' — GEN SG s'a-l. To же может происходить, впрочем, и в абсолютном конце слова, ср. варианты Sij и ST 'молоко', GEN SG Si-i
# (twol rule may be required to handle the above regulation)
# ...
# added adjDouble & adjSingle for testing adjective agreement rules
# added agrInitial, agrMiddle & agrFinal to implement the agreement
# 2 twol rules for consonant conversion after nasalized vowels need to be implemented 
# ᵸ is to be used in the rules
# not sure, how to gloss initial agreement markers in verbs & adjectives, so that glosses don't come before the lemma
# left them without glosses for the time being
# ...
# implemented the 2 twol rules
# may need a rule for -a reduction at the end of the stem
# a common pattern in nominal declension
# ...
# ? question for the next time: which form should be used as the lemma for words with agreement markers
# ? -i at the end of the plural marker -abi can be either implemented as the absolutive case marker or via twol rule
# the latter approach makes it difficult to gloss it
# decided to implement it separately with a "nom" gloss
# temporarily changed PlAbi to PlBi.
# ? Need to decide, how to implement the vowel joints
# ...
# The absolutive stem might have a final -a that would be reduced in the oblique forms
# This makes the solution with a reduceable archphoneme -a at the end of the stem and a vowel at the start of the marker more convenient
# ...
# converbs & participles: may agree with 2 targets, so the scheme of "double adjectives" is reusable
# negative markers will be added to nominalized nouns as an optional suffix
# ...
# zero-marker nominative added to cases, classs nullNom to make an exception for nominalized numbers
# ...
# ? dative fusion is denied in the bagvalal vocabulary, it seems reasonable to cover both options
# Personal pronouns added in PerPronStems lexicon entry, exceptions listed in PerPronounExc
# added RegErg class to cases for correct personal pronoun coverage. PrExc added to pronouns for the same purpose
# ...
# optional negative suffixes added to personal pronouns, nominalized numbers - excluding genitive forms
# future goal: specify nominalized adjectives
# ...
# added ordinal lexicon entry to describe ordinal numbers
